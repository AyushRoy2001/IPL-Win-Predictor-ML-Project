## *2. Description*
  -> I created an ML model for predicting the win percentage of the chasing team for an IPL match.<br/> 
  -> Used Logistic Regression for this project.<br/>
  -> The website where the model was implemented was made using Streamlit library of python.<br/>
  -> Used Column Transformer and One Hot Encoder in pipeline for data processing.<br/>
  -> Saved the model using Pickle library in python.<br/>
 ## *3. Dataset*
  -> Two datasets are used for the project(deliveries and match).<br/>
  -> the datasets are processed and merged for the required dataset.<br/>
  -> Datasets taken from ![Logo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kaggle-20BEFF?style=for-the-badge&logo=Kaggle&logoColor=white).<br/>
