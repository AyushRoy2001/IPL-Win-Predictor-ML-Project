2. Description
  -> I created an ML model for predicting the win percentage of the chasing team for an IPL match. 
  -> Used Logistic Regression for this project.
  -> The website where the model was implemented was made using Streamlit library of python.
  -> Used Column Transformer and One Hot Encoder in pipeline for data processing.
  -> Saved the model using Pickle library in python.
 3. Dataset
  -> Two datasets are used for the project(deliveries and match)
  -> the datasets are processed and merged for the required dataset
  -> Datasets taken from Kaggle
 5. Contributers
  -> Ayush Roy
